Since that moment on, I started saving my pennies and searching for a Bronco to call my own. I found a 1972 rusty steed in a farmerâ€™s field with a 
small tree growing up through the engine block and turned it into this dream machine (pictured below) built for off road and street cruising!</pre>");

Time to start tracking how much this newest project is costing me.</pre></h3>");
